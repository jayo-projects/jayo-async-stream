# Jayo AsyncStream

`AsyncStream<T>` is an initiative to provide the simplest API to model an async stream of elements that are being
produced asynchronously.

It is available on Maven Central.

Gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.jayo:jayo-async-stream:X.Y.Z")
}
```

Maven:
```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.jayo</groupId>
    <artifactId>jayo-async-stream</artifactId>
    <version>X.Y.Z</version>
</dependency>
```

The Jayo AsyncStream code is written in Java without the use of any external dependencies, to be as light as possible.

Jayo AsyncStream requires Java 11 or more recent.
